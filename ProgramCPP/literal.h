// This file contains the definition of the Literal class, whose representation consists of the value
// of the literal. Because both of its functions are one line functions, they are implemented as inline 
// functions. The constructor saves the value of the literal. Because this class is a subclass of Operand
// which in turn is a subclass of Expression, it must implement the function evaluate, which returns the
// value that corresponds to the literal.

// I only changed the number type to accept float.
